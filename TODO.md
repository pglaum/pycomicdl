These are some nice to have features that I'll work on when I find time and
motivation...

- url variability: if the hoster changes domains, we want to be able to quickly
  switch to it, without changing the code.
- cbz format
- epub format
- updater to fetch new chapters in a recurring series
- possibility to select a range of chapters to download
- config file: default download directory, download options, hoster url
